This is an intern for Prodigy InfoTech where I summarize all the tasks I have performed

Task 1: I created a histogram using python libraries such as pandas to visualize the distribution of income group based on region. The dataset was acquired from UN and it has extended my knowledge of different data visualizations

Task 2: I learned how to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis by inspecting the correlation between different features using matplotlib as well as finding patterns in the RMS titanic dataset 

Task 3: In this task, Ideveloped a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether clients of a Portuguese banking institution would subscribe to a term deposit based on various features derived from marketing campaigns with the model achieving an overall accuracy of 79% on the testing set. The dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, was preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Task 4: In this task, I performed data cleaning to remove unnecessary characters and standardize the text, created a preprocessing function for tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, and utilized NLTK's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. I then calculated the percentage distribution of each sentiment type in the dataset and generated word clouds to visualize the most frequent words.

Task 5: In the final task, I have analyzed a traffic accident dataset from US to visualize patterns in roadway conditions, weather conditions and the Age group. I performed data cleaning and plotted graphs ranging from the number of accidents based on age and whether using heatmap to gain insights of the accidents based on atmospheric conditions and roadways
